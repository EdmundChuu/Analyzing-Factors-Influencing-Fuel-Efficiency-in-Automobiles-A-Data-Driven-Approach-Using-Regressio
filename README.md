This project examines the factors influencing fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), in automobiles. Recognizing the environmental and economic importance of optimizing fuel consumption, we analyze a dataset ("auto-mpg.data") containing vehicle attributes such as displacement, cylinders, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year. The study employs linear regression models, including interaction terms, to capture relationships between variables and identify significant predictors of MPG. Lasso regression is further utilized to address multicollinearity and improve model interpretability. Results from this analysis provide insights for designing more fuel-efficient vehicles and inform strategies for reducing environmental impact through improved automotive technologies.
